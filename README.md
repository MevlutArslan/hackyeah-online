We couldnt finish the project within the given time constraints :( ... 

Project Description : 

Ever since the Polish government took into effect the new law that limits the number of people that can be present in a grocery store at a given time. Another problem started emerging, we started seeing long queues in front of markets which can become a way for the virus to spread through shoppers. To avoid this we have created an informative app that uses the already existing infrastructure in grocery stores and informs the general public about things like the number of people at the store in realtime , when was the last time it was sanitized, how many people have been to the shop since the last sanitization and much more. We have also implemented a virtual queue system for every shop in our database to avoid people piling up outside the shops.
